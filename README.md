Question: Can our social-cultural understanding of a mundane object, in this case a ‘postal-system’ prevent, hinder, or mask our ability to recognize objects as an invitation for surveillance or threat?

Aim: To explore how mundane objects can be employed for surveillance practices, and by placing it back into a public environment, how would this change our preconceived notions about ordinary objects in our environment.

Investigation:

- Political infrastructures on surveillance, surveillance capitalism
- Using mundane objects as a mode of trickery/deception to aid in surveillance practices
- Invasion of privacy and security
- Ethical Considerations behind using mundane objects


Overview:

'Mailman Says Cheese!' stages an experience of surveillance. Servo motors and distance sensors are used to create movement - imitating the notion of motion detection and tracking in surveillance cameras. LEDs are used to imitate the notion of video capturing and recording. The whole experience attempts to create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere and thus, reflects how surveillance practices are rapidly becoming a more intensive and normal instrument of modern government.

Utilizing a playful and satirical approach, the project raises substantial debates on street surveillance, thereby challenging the regulation of surveillance practices as they become woven into the fabric of everyday mundane objects.

Can our social-cultural understanding of a mundane object, in this case a ‘postal-system’ prevent, hinder, or mask our ability to recognize objects as an invitation for surveillance?

To what extent can mundane objects be replaced as surveillance devices that can pose threat to our privacy?
